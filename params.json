{"name":"TeX Live Utility","tagline":"","body":"=============\r\nWHAT IS THIS?\r\n=============\r\n\r\nTeX Live Utility is a Mac OS X graphical interface for TeX Live Manager. \r\nIt aims to provide a native Mac OS X interface for the most commonly \r\nused functions of the TeX Live Manager command-line tool.\r\n\r\nTeX Live 2008 and later come with the TeX Live Manager for updating, \r\ninstalling, and otherwise managing a TeX installation. It includes a \r\ncross-platform Perl/Tk graphical interface, and a command-line \r\ninterface (tlmgr). The cross-platform Perl/Tk interface is less \r\nMac-like, but provides access to more features.\r\n\r\nDevelopment is moving to GitHub, but the old\r\n`Project page <https://code.google.com/p/mactlmgr/>`_ is still active.\r\n\r\n===========\r\nCOMPILATION\r\n===========\r\n\r\nTo check out:\r\n\r\n* In Terminal: ``git clone https://github.com/amaxwell/tlutility``\r\n* in the source directory, run::\r\n      \r\n    git submodule init   \r\n    git submodule update\r\n\r\n  to pull the necessary submodules.\r\n* open ``TeX Live Utility.xcodeproj`` and set the scheme to\r\n  ``TeX Live Utility (Debug)`` or release, and build it\r\n* it should build in Xcode on 10.8 and later\r\n\r\n=======\r\nLICENSE\r\n=======\r\n\r\nTeX Live Utility and associated scripts are released under the BSD license as follows:\r\n\r\nThis software is Copyright (c) 2010-2014\r\nAdam Maxwell.
